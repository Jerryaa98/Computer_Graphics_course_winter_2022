# Assignmnet1Report_Part3

#### Overview
this is part 3 of assignment 1, basically we added a couple of features to the previous part, we modified the GUI such that now it can also draw all axis for different models and the world, also now we have the ability to add cameras and do different operations using these cameras like rotations and translations, and because we can add multiple cameras we can also change out "eye" and our point of view on the models.
gifs and screenshots will make it easier to understand down the page.

## Cameras

we implimented a camera with an orthographic projection, and gave the user the ability to change the view volume in different directions using the UI.

** near and far don't affect the projection here **
